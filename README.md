##  ⚽Predicting the Player Lineup of Manchester United Team: Applied Machine Learning⚽ 
In this project, I conducted experiments utilizing a combination of traditional machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural network models implemented using TensorFlow. The objective was to predict the optimal player lineup for Manchester United based on historical statistics. By analyzing relevant data and employing various machine learning techniques, I aimed to make informed decisions regarding player selection, ultimately enhancing the team's performance.
