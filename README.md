Prediction of player lineup of Manchester United team 
In this project, I conducted experiments using machine learning classifiers on the lineup team of Manchester United. The aim was to predict which players should be included in the lineup based on historical statistics. 
By analyzing relevant data, I aimed to make informed decisions regarding player selection, ultimately enhancing the team's performance.
