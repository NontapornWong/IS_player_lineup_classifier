###  âš½Enhancing Player Selection Strategies: Machine Learning for Manchester United's Lineup Prediction
  In this project, I conducted experiments utilizing a combination of traditional machine learning classifiers and neural network models implemented using TensorFlow. The primary objective was to predict the optimal player lineup for Manchester United based on historical statistics. To obtain the necessary data, I performed web scraping from "https://fbref.com/", extracting relevant information such as player performance metrics and match data.

  Through extensive experimentation, I tested multiple traditional machine learning models. However, after careful evaluation, three models demonstrated the most potential in effectively working with this dataset. These models included Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, I implemented neural network models using TensorFlow to leverage the power of deep learning for improved predictions.
